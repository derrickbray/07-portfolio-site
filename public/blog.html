            Our first day was a bit rough. We were introduced to The IronYard by trying to fix extremely broken code.
             Our Instruction built a website and then took a sledgehammer to it. He removed class names, removed the
             links, and made many syntax errors. We receivedthe assignment late in the afternoon and told to fix it by tomorrow.

            Our introduction to JavaScript was to build a blackjack game.  The app would tell the player to stay, hit,
            or split based on the cards it was given.  It is a very simple game but full of loops and if/else statements.
              It was hard for the first day, but very cool.  It was amazing to see a few lines of code move and manipulate
              data like that.

            In week 4 we had a group project with the back-end class to make a ping pong game tracker.  Our front-end
            group had to communicate and work with a database that was built for us.  It was interesting to see how much
            non-coding work had to be put into the project.  We spent a lot of time just talking about how the app
            should work and what it should look like.  It was a great opportunity to understand how real projects get done.

            For the weekend assignment we built an app using the Marvel api.  It was my favorite build.  Using the search
            bar you can find a series and the page pulls up the characters associated with that series and the related
            comics.  Each character and comic comes with a read more button that will pull up the description and
            display an overlay with the information.  Itâ€™s pretty cool.
